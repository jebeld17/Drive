# Drive

##  What is this?
Drive is a simple Electron wrapper housing the Google Drive website. Simply put, it's a simple, minimal web browser locked down to just the Drive site. This is a native Windows app.

The program is a work-in-progress with an installer in the works. For now, you can download the program's "Master" branch and run the included ".lnk" file to get going.
